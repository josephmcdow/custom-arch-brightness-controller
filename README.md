# custom-arch-brightness-controller
This is a program I use with binds in i3 to modify my screen brightness. It didnt come natively with this support so I made it myself, it only runs on my screen but im sure it would be easy to make run on your own machine with just a little bit of modification.


# how to use
there are three arguments you can use 
-i [number?] to increase by a number amount, or by one if left blank
-d [number?] to decrease by a number amount, or by one if left blank
-s [number] to set to a particular number, if left blank, will just set brightness to 1
